# Alpha-Project
Source code used for my Alpha Project, used for identifying the characteristics of the duodenum tissue by analyzing the proximity between certain populations of immune cells, by comparison with tissues affected by GvHD.
The project was conducted as part of research on the characterization of GvHD (Graft versus Host Disease), supervised by the Weizmann Institute of Science.

  - A clearer README presenting the research specifications will be added soon.

  - Files will be re-uploaded with fixed path names.

  - Example data needed for running the project will be created and uploaded, as the data used for my analysis is under copyright.

For now, source files are included along with raw output data ('hists' folder).

### This project was supervised by Nofar Azulai, Department of Molecular Biology, the Weizmann Institute of Science.
